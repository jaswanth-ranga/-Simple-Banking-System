# Simple Banking System

A Java-based banking application enabling account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. Built with Spring Boot for backend APIs and a frontend using either Java Swing or HTML/CSS/JavaScript, this project showcases CRUD operations, REST API integration, and object-oriented design. Future enhancements include database storage, user authentication, and transaction history tracking.
